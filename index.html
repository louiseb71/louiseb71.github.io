            Here at the Compost Connection, we believe that soil matters.<br><br>
            People don’t usually think much about the six inches of soil beneath their feet. We trample it, dig it up and neglect it. But soil is what keeps us all alive and we are learning that it’s home to billions of living creatures: fungi, bacteria and all sorts of organisms that work together to help plants grow and support life on Earth.<br><br>
            We work to help people look after their soil, so that their soil can look after all of us. We run a range of practical, hands on workshops and can offer advice on setting up a composting system that works for you, whether this is at home, on your allotment or a community growing project. Visit our Facebook page to find out more.
